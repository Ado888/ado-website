        <p>I am an introvert who always stays at home. But I also love 
            being with the company of friends. I love to learn coding
            and listen to podcasts. I have a cat pet name Zenitsu, or Nitsu
            for short. I also have a dog pet name Bella. And most of all
            I have a very loving family - Eden, my long time partner, Constantine,
            my youngest son, and Samara, my daughter. They continue to inspire me 
            and help me push myself to do something useful in life. With that,
            I want to thank them
        </p>
